# bash-ps1

Yet another bash `PS1` utility.

Currently this provides a live preview of your `PS1` but my aim is to make this
able to function as a generator like some of the other existing ones. Built on
bootstrap, I'd like to add in colour selectors that will match to nearest as per
the [`image-to-ansi`](https://dom.hastin.gs/files/image-to-ansi) script I've
worked on recenctly.

Whilst this isn't particularly different to make of the others generators that
exist, I enjoyed making the preview component which is managed pretty much
entirely `CSS`.

Feel free to fork this, you can
[see it in action here](https://dom.hastin.gs/files/bash-ps1).
